## 🕮 Our 'Moedige poging' bible a.k.a agreements 
1. Everyone shall work at their own pace and time, but the agreed upon tasks should be done by a determined deadline
2. We shall keep each other up to date during a 15 min call each day
⁠3. Everyone shall be open about what they are working and notify if they need help
4. Everyone shall trust one another and don’t put all the workload on themselves or push it to someone else
5. We shall meet each monday and each coordinator has prepared what they want to do that week and what/who they need that week and we make a todo list and planning together

## Everything you need to know about the dev part of the project
### Tools used
* **Software**
    * **React router** - Our website has a lot of different states (and some different pages), so we decided to make everything in react router.

    * **Arduino IDE** - We have a physical part attached to the concept. To get that part up and running, we used an arduino.

    * **WebSockets** - The arduinos get real-time data from a database. With a websocket server we could make this work.
    * **Supabase** - For our database we made use of supabase. It's a database where it is easy to get real-time updates in our server.

* **Hardware**
    * Arduino nano IOT
    * Steppermotor 28byj-48
    * Button or micro switch
    * Led matrix 
    * Led strip
    * power supply
    * one laptop to run the server
    * one smartphone to run the website

### The database
Create your own database in Supabase.
These are the three tables needed:

**Table clocks**<br>
`
create table public.clocks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  name text null,
  "scheduledStartTime" timestamp without time zone null,
  "scheduldedStopTime" timestamp without time zone null,
  "clockWallPos" smallint null,
  description text null,
  private boolean null default false,
  "startTime" timestamp without time zone null,
  "stopTime" timestamp without time zone null,
  creator uuid null,
  location text null,
  "abbyMade" boolean null default false,
  constraint Clocks_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint clocks_creator_fkey foreign KEY (creator) references profiles (id),
  constraint clocks_description_check check ((length(description) < 300))
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
`

**Table clockprofile**<br>
`
create table public.clockprofile (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  profile_id uuid not null,
  clock_id bigint not null,
  constraint clockprofile_pkey primary key (profile_id, clock_id),
  constraint clock_profile_clock_id_fkey foreign KEY (clock_id) references clocks (id),
  constraint clock_profile_profile_id_fkey foreign KEY (profile_id) references profiles (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
`

**Table profiles**<br>
`
create table public.profiles (
  id uuid not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone null,
  username text null,
  constraint profiles_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint profiles_username_key unique (username),
  constraint profiles_id_fkey foreign KEY (id) references auth.users (id) on delete CASCADE,
  constraint username_length check ((char_length(username) >= 3))
) TABLESPACE pg_default;
`

Don't forget to setup the authentication in the database.

### The arduino(s) & the websocket server
#### Database -> Server --> Arduinos
When something is changing in the database (table Clocks), the websocket server receives a message from the database and sends it to the right arduino.

#### The arduino
Make the arduino connection (see table & drawing)

|Component|Arduino Pin|
|-|-----------|
|Ledmatrix In| pin 18|
|Ledstrip In| pin 19|
|steppermotor IN1| pin 14|
|steppermotor IN2| pin 15|
|steppermotor IN3| pin 16|
|steppermotor IN4| pin 17|

|Component|power supply|
|-|-----------|
|Ledmatrix| arduino |
|Ledmatrix| arduino |
|steppermotor| external power supply |


#### How to setup?
**STEP1: Create an arduino_secrets.h**
- with this content: <br> `#define SECRET_SSID "our wifi name"` <br>
`#define SECRET_PASS "password"`
- change this line with the ip-adress of the server <br>
`char serverAddress[] = "172.30.248.128";`

**STEP2: Upload the code to the arduino**

**STEP3: make an .env file in the folder clocks**
- with this content: <br> `VITE_API_BASE_URL="url of supabase database"` <br>
`VITE_API_KEY="the key"`

**STEP4: total clocks/arduino**
- you can change the amount of clocks connected to one arduino. <br>
change this line: `const clocksPerArduino = 2;` in clocks/server/index.cjs
- you can define how many arduinos are connected <br>
change this line: `export const clocksPerArduino = 2;` in app/services/museumData.js


**STEP5: Open the server**
- cd clocks
- npm i (to install al the dependencies)
- nmp run start

> **Some important things to now** <br>
Their is no build in connection check in the server. So If the Arduino loses connection you have to restart the server and the arduino.<br>
The clock is working with a button to determine its starting position. Don't forget to push it when the arduino starts. You can also change the button with a micro switch that is triggered by the stepper motor.

### Our website
**STEP1: make an .env file in main folder**
- with this content: <br> `VITE_API_BASE_URL="url of supabase database"` <br>
`#define VITE_API_KEY="the key"`

**STEP2: install all the depencies**
- npm i

**STEP3: run it**
- npm run dev

> At some point the website makes use of a qr-code.
generate your own qr-codes and exchange this part of the code with your own querystring.
`if (result.data === "yourBase/qrCode") {` in app/components/form/qr-code.jsx

> **or just use our online website and this qr-code**<br>

### Future work
- At the moment we filter in the database and load the data on the different pages. This causes some delays. So to improve the user experience. Its better to get the data once and filter client-side.
- The filter on the page 'abbymomenten' isn't working. In the future it should work.
- The website is only for mobile and not responsive at the moment.
- The edit page isn't designed and working yet.
- The the files could be cleaned up.
